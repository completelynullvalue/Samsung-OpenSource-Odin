To create this, I did the following:
- De-compiled the leaked Odin4 binary with IDA 9.1 to a C++ reconstruction.
- Trained an AI on this code.
- Created an equivalent reconstruction of that code, ported to Python 3!

 Windows note:
- The windows version DOES require Zadig to set the USB driver of your Samsung device to libusbK.

Additional options:
- OEM Unlock (only for some devices)
- Disable signature verification (For flashing client side, on Bootloader it will STILL enforce)
- Option Lock
- Unbricks devices that have a failed software update
